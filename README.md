# SQL-Based Business Transaction & Analytics System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database using MySQL to store and analyze business transaction data. The system focuses on extracting meaningful business insights from transactional data using SQL queries.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL
- SQL

## Database Design
The database consists of four main tables:
- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- Order_Details

These tables are connected using primary and foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity.

## Key Features
- Normalized relational database design
- Complex SQL queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- SQL views for reporting and analysis
- Indexing and constraints for performance and data integrity
- Business analytics including revenue trends and customer behavior

## Sample Analytical Queries
- Total revenue generated
- Revenue by customer
- Monthly sales trends
- Top customers by spending
- Product performance analysis

## How to Run
1. Create the database using `schema/create_tables.sql`
2. Insert sample data using `data/insert_sample_data.sql`
3. Run analytical queries from the `queries` folder
4. Explore views and optimization scripts

## Learning Outcomes
- Relational database design
- SQL analytics and reporting
- Query optimization techniques
- Translating raw data into business insights
